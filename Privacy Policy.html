        <h1>Privacy Policy for Sadhana</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 26, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to Sadhana ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.</p>

        <h2>1. COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:</p>
        
        <h3>Personal Data</h3>
        <p>While using our App, we do not require you to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, shipping address, email address, or telephone number. All user-created content is stored locally on your device.</p>
        
        <h3>User-Created Content</h3>
        <p>We collect and store the mantras that you manually add to the application. This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers unless you use features that require cloud synchronization, which would be explicitly stated.</p>

        <h3>Derivative Data</h3>
        <p>Information our servers do not automatically collect, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and after accessing the App. This app is designed to function primarily offline.</p>
        
        <h3>Data From Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>Our App uses third-party services for in-app purchases and AI features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> To manage "Sadhana Pro" subscriptions, we use RevenueCat. RevenueCat may collect device and purchase data to validate and restore purchases. We do not receive your personal payment details (like credit card numbers). You can view RevenueCat's privacy policy for more information.</li>
            <li><strong>Google's Gemini API:</strong> For the AI-powered mantra search feature, your search queries are sent to Google's Gemini API to generate results. We do not include any personal identifiers in these requests. Google's handling of data is governed by their own privacy policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>Having accurate information permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the App to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manage your "Sadhana Pro" subscription and restore purchases.</li>
            <li>Provide AI-generated mantra suggestions based on your search queries.</li>
            <li>Improve the functionality and user experience of the App.</li>
            <li>Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties. Your data is your own. The only instances where data is shared are with the third-party services mentioned above (RevenueCat and Google) as an essential part of the App's functionality.</p>

        <h2>4. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the data you provide to us, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>

        <h2>5. POLICY FOR CHILDREN</h2>
        <p>We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.</p>

        <h2>6. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access the mantras you have saved in the app at any time.</li>
            <li>Delete any mantra you have added to the app.</li>
            <li>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, you have certain data protection rights, covered by GDPR.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of our updates.</p>
