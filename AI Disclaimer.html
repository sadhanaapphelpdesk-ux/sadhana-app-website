        <h1>AI Feature Disclaimer</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 26, 2025</p>

        <p>The "Sadhana" application offers a feature that uses a large language model (AI), specifically Google's Gemini API, to help users discover new mantras based on search queries. Please read and understand the following disclaimer regarding the use of this AI-powered feature.</p>

        <h2>1. Nature of AI-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>The mantras suggested by the AI are generated algorithmically. While the AI is trained on a vast amount of text and data, it does not possess consciousness, beliefs, or an understanding of spiritual concepts in a human sense. The suggestions are based on patterns and associations in the data it was trained on.</p>

        <h2>2. No Guarantee of Accuracy or Authenticity</h2>
        <p>We do not guarantee the accuracy, authenticity, or traditional validity of the mantras provided by the AI search feature. The AI may generate content that is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inaccurate or contains errors.</li>
            <li>A misinterpretation or a combination of different traditional sources.</li>
            <li>Incomplete or lacking proper context.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users are strongly encouraged to verify any AI-generated mantras with reliable spiritual texts, teachers, or scholars before adoption into their personal practice.</p>

        <h2>3. Not a Substitute for Professional Guidance</h2>
        <p>The AI feature is intended for discovery and informational purposes only. It is not a substitute for guidance from a qualified guru, spiritual teacher, or religious scholar. The practice of chanting mantras can have profound effects, and it is best to approach it with proper understanding and guidance.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>By using the AI search feature in the Sadhana app, you agree that we, the developers, are not liable for any misunderstandings, inaccuracies, or any spiritual, emotional, or psychological outcomes that may arise from the use of AI-generated content. You assume full responsibility for how you use the information provided by the AI.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Responsibility</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for critically evaluating the content generated by the AI. We encourage a mindful and discerning approach when exploring new mantras suggested by this feature.</p>
